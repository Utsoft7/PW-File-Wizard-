# **PW-File-Wizard**
**Welcome everyone to Project File-Wizard.**    

## Objective:  
The primary goal of Project File Wizard is to create a versatile file format conversion tool hosted on the AWS Cloud. Using AWS services such as S3 buckets and Lambda functions, the project aims to allow users to convert various file formats, including documents (e.g., DOCX), into different formats such as PDF. Integrating S3 and Lambda will streamline the conversion process, providing a scalable and efficient solution.
